### Purpose of `default.json` and `latest.json`

- **`default.json`**:
The `default.json` file is created if no profiles exist in the profiles directory when the application is launched. It serves as a fallback profile with default settings to ensure that there is always at least one profile available.

- **`latest.json`**:
  - **Purpose**: The `latest.json` file stores the settings of the most recently used profile. 
  - **Usage**: Whenever a profile is saved, the settings are also saved to `latest.json`. If `latest.json` exists, it is loaded as the active profile when the application starts. If it doesn't exist, the `default.json` profile is loaded instead.

Feather is closed source, this means we cannot extrapolate what are its incompatibilities with raven XD.
In addition, we do not wish to support a launcher that is known to have stolen code form open source mods without mentioning them anywhere.

TL;DR: Feather bad, use an actual launcher, whose job is to just launch the game, and possibly handle mods. We'll never work towards compatibility with Feather
